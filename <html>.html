            A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console, the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.
            Step 1: To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Ctrl +Shift +J (on Windows).
